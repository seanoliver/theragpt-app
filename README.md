## ‚ùì FAQ

### Is my data private?

Yes! Your journal entries and thought analyses are private by default. We do not share your data with third parties, and all data is stored locally on your device unless you opt-in to persistent storage via Supabase.

### Is TheraGPT free to use?

TheraGPT is currently free to use. In the future, we may introduce a subscription tier for AI usage after a certain amount of daily queries to cover API costs. However, the source code will always remain open, allowing you to self-host the application.

### Can I use TheraGPT without a user account?

Yes! You can use TheraGPT without creating an account. All of your historical journal entries will be stored locally on your device. However, you can store your journal entries in our cloud database if you'd prefer by creating a user account.

### Can TheraGPT replace professional therapy?

No. TheraGPT is designed as a supplementary tool to help practice CBT techniques, but it is not a replacement for professional mental health care. If you're experiencing severe distress, please consult with a licensed therapist or counselor.

### How accurate is the AI analysis?

While our AI models are trained on CBT principles and cognitive distortion patterns, they are not perfect. The analysis should be viewed as a helpful starting point for reflection rather than a definitive diagnosis.

### When will the mobile app be available?

We're actively working on the mobile version of TheraGPT using Expo/React Native. Stay tuned for updates on our release timeline.
