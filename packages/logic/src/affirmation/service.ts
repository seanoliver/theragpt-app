  `I know which actions bring me closer to my goals and which ones take me away from them. I focus on the former and work to eliminate the latter. Currently, these actions include:\n- spending **high quality time** with Tina, Mika, and Kai,\n- giving Tina's reactions and feedback the **sincere attention** they deserve,\n- **physical fitness**,\n- **mindful meditation**,\n- **conscious and purposeful eating**,\n- **curating exceptional notes**,\n- **writing**,\n- **building and learning,**\n- setting a **realistic and achievable daily intention**, and\n- reading this personal manifesto with the **knowing conviction** that its words are true.`,
  `I know that **alcohol and drugs take me away from my goals** by sapping my energy, my creativity, my compassion, and my capacity for mindfulness.`,
  `I create positive habits, and I know that **progress comes little by little**. By making a 1% improvement every day, I will change my life dramatically over time.`,
  `I do not get down about my mistakes as they are proof that I am trying. The more I practice trying, failing, and learning, the easier it will become. I know **the only thing that counts is what I do from now on**.`,
  `I know that working on a problem reduces my resistance to it. It is harder to fear things when I am making progress on themâ€”even if that progress is imperfect and slow. **Action relieves anxiety**.`,
  `I know that **when I embrace discomfort, I embrace progress**. It is only by challenging myself that I will continue to grow toward my dreams.`,
  `I strongly believe in the path I am on. I do not judge others, nor do I compare myself to others. **Everyone is on their own path, and I will focus on mine**.`,
  `I know that how I do anything is how I do everything and that challenge today leads to change tomorrow. I get stronger with each good choice I make, and **my dreams will not work unless I do**.`
